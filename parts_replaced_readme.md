# Technics SL-1350 Replacement Parts List Cross-Reference
This page describes the worksheets for the part bill of materials, and tracking the replacement of parts.

## BOM Source
Bill of materials (BOM) comes from SL-1300 and SL-1350 parts lists.
* Originally did not have access to SL-1350 pdfs because VinylEngine account access process is dumb.
* I pulled from the generic service supplement:  audio.turntable.technics.sl-1350.manual.service.ve_technics_sl-1300_1310_1350_1500_1510_service_sup.pdf

The BOM I used and tracking of the parts I replaced is in file [parts_bom/audio.turntable.technics_sl-1350.parts_list.ods](parts_bom/audio.turntable.technics_sl-1350.parts_list.ods). ODS files are from libreoffice/openoffice but should work find in Excel, Google Docs or other spreadsheet editors.
