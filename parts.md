Capacitors 
-------

Per [link](https://electronics.stackexchange.com/questions/69919/ceramic-vs-film-capacitor-which-one-is-preferred-in-audio-circuits). 

Film Capacitor 
* typically denotes polyester or polymer film as the dielectric 
* metallized film capacitors are the same thing: metallic coating 
  being applied to an extremely thin polymer film, to create 
  the conducting electrodes of the capacitor. 


Ceramic capacitors 
* somewhat non-linear in their frequency and voltage responses, 
  compared to film capacitors. 
* tend to behave as microphones, thus picking up ambient sound 
  and modulating the voltage across them accordingly.

* non-polarized capacitors: Ceramic and Film capacitors 
* polarized capacitors: Electrolytic and Super Capacitors 
* longer lead generally +

[Quality Perspectives from EEVBlog](https://www.eevblog.com/forum/chat/capacitor-brands/)

* quality vendors in general (no particular order)
  * Rubycon
  * Chemi-Con
  * Nichicon
  * Panasonic
  * Suncon (former Sanyo)
  * TDK (former Epcos)
  * Kemet
  * Vishay
  * Cornell Dubilier - CDE
  * ELNA
* Vishay and Kemet are not "premium" grade electrolytic manufacturers. Kemet makes fine poly's and Vishay makes fine ceramic caps.
  * Vishay electrolytics are ex BC components / Philips / Mullard and Sprague which are high end. T
* I would not recommend ether as first choice for Electrolytics.
* Cornell Dubilier makes good very large capacity electrolytics but is not preferable in my opinion in small values.
* For electrolytics, I generally stick to Nichicon, Panasonic, or Rubycon


* identify non-marked bi-polar
  * tested a capacitor using my meter's diode test function.
  * When connected correctly, the voltage slowly increases, until it goes out of range >2V, but when connected backwards, it settles at around 1.7V.
  * The test didn't work with all capacitors. 
  * Some will charge to a higher voltage, when reversed biased. Use a 5V power supply and a suitable resistor to limit the current, to a safe level. After reverse charging a capacitor, always reform it by recharging it to near the rated voltage.

Resistors
-------

* Metal film less noisy than carbon film 

* smaller PPM means smaller temperature change per degree C 


Transistors
-------

* [replacement guide](https://alltransistors.com/how_to_choose_replacement_for_bipolar_transistor.php)
  * bipolar transistor
    * hFE current transfer coefficient (like gain)
      * demands on-off: hFE must be more than or equal to the required coefficient
      * in the analogue boosters or in similar devices, it has to be close to hFE
      * In impulse power supplies, the analogue transistors should be chosen with the close hFE (it will be necessary to change also the working transistor standing in a pair).
  * check the temperature mode (heating) of the transistor after switching on the device. If the transistor is excessively hot, the problem may be both in the transistor, or in the non-working elements of its bundling. 
* some suggest searching littlediode.com in UK for parts, stick with big guys Mouser, etc to avoid counterfeit parts
* TR1: 2SD389
* TR2: 2SA720
  * [audiokarma @rottalpha](https://audiokarma.org/forums/index.php?threads/transistor-substitutions.688515/) suggests KSA1013 or KSA1220 *check voltages
* TR3 12 13 15: 2SC1328
  * audiokarma @rottalpha suggests 2SC1328 â€”> KSC1845
* TR4 5 6 10 11 14: 2SA666AI-R
  * try MCM (became Newark per [history](https://www.icrfq.com/blog/what-happened-to-MCMElectronics.html)); do not have

* TR7 8 9: 2SC1384
  * audiokarma @rottalpha suggests KSC2690
